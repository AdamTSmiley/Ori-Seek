# Ori-Seek

Ori-Seek is a Python script that uses the Biopython and Vienna RNA 2.0
libraries to search a provided .FASTA file containing all publicly
available and complete genomes of CRESS-DNA viruses (downloaded from
NCBI Virus) for putative Origins of replication based on pre-defined
semi-ambiguous Ori-sequences and genomic folding into hairpin-like
structures.

We have provided the code, the original data file used for analysis, the manually assembled list of genomes that return false positives, and all
result files on GitHub and our laboratory website (www.Mechanosome.org)
